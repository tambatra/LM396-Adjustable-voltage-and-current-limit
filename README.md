# LM317/LM350/LM338/LM396-Adjustable-voltage-and-current-limit
In this project, I'm designing an adjustable voltage and current limit circuit based on LM396 10A linear regulator and 20V laptop charger that i've salvaged from my old laptop. You can replace the LM396 with LM317, LM350 or LM338 for others current ratings.
This circuit can be used to charge any batteries that have nominal voltage in the range of 1.5V to 12V.
Voltage and current limit is adjusted with two rotary switch.
Please find the schematic and photo in the attached file.
